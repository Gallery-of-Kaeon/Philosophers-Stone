### How does it work?

Individual Philosopher's Stones act as wrappers for components of larger systems.

Philosopher's Stones may be connected to one another to form a graph called a Philosopher's Atlas.
Connections between Philosopher's Stones are one way and may either be public or private.

Once connected, the Philosopher's Stones may communicate with each other by sending packets throughout the graph.
