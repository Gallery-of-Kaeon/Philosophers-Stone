<h1 align="center">Philosopher's Stone</h1>

The Philosopher's Stone is a method for constructing an intranet like system within the architecture of an application using a directed graph in which any variable or module may act as a node. Said graph is referred to as a Philosopher's Atlas.

### How does it work?

The Philosopher's Stone API stores a global adjancency matrix in which any variable or module within a program may act as a node,
and also provides special utilities for interacting with modules acting as nodes when the implementation of said modules is unknown.

### What advantages are there to using Philosopher's Stones?

Whereas in most programs modules communicate with one another by sending data to a specified endpoint,
the Philosopher's Stone method allows modules to essentially "broadcast" to one another via sending "packets" through graph traversals,
thereby allowing modules to be added or modified without necessarily having to refactor others that are dependent upon them,
whether mid-project or even mid-runtime.
This method is optimal for projects with unpredictable development circumstances and for programs designed to take on new functionality at runtime.

### Has the Philosopher's Stone ever actually been used for anything?

Yes!
Three of the other projects on this github account make use of the Philosopher's Stone.

The [Kaeon FUSION](https://github.com/Gallery-of-Kaeon/Kaeon-FUSION/blob/master/README.md) interpreter is built using Philosopher's Stones,
and the [ACE Game Engine Model](https://github.com/Gallery-of-Kaeon/Kaeon-ACE/blob/master/Kaeon%20ACE/Documentation/Game%20Engine%20Model/README.md) and [SOUL](https://github.com/Gallery-of-Kaeon/SOUL/blob/master/README.md) make use of them as well.
