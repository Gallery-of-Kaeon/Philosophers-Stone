### How does it work?

Individual Philosopher's Stones act as wrappers for components of larger systems.

Philosopher's Stones may be connected to one another to form a graph called a Philosopher's Atlas.
Connections between Philosopher's Stones are one way and may either be public or private.

Once connected, the Philosopher's Stones may communicate with each other by sending packets throughout the graph.

### What advantages are there to using Philosopher's Stones?

Philosopher's Stones allow the various components of an application to be isolated.
Entire components of your application can be added and removed without causing the application to crash.
You can even program parts of your program to interact with other parts that haven't been implemented yet.

For example,
lets say stone A activates a function in stone B by sending a packet to it.
If you decide to modify what happens after the packet is sent,
you can replace stone B with stone C without modifying stone A.

### Has the Philosopher's Stone ever actually been used for anything?

Yes!
Three of the other projects on this github account make use of the Philosopher's Stone.

The [Kaeon FUSION](https://github.com/Gallery-of-Kaeon/Kaeon-FUSION/blob/master/README.md) interpreter is built using Philosopher's Stones,
and the [ACE Game Engine Model](https://github.com/Gallery-of-Kaeon/Kaeon-ACE/blob/master/Kaeon%20ACE/Documentation/Game%20Engine%20Model/README.md) and [SOUL](https://github.com/Gallery-of-Kaeon/SOUL/blob/master/README.md) make use of them as well.
