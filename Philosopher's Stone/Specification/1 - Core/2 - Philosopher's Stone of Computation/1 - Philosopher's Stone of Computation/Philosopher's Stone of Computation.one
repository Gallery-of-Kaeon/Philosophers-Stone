			The Philosopher's Stone of Computation is a interface for dynamically invoking any
			operation such that if said operation causes an error then said operation shall
			terminate and said error shall be caught, and if said operation finishes successfully
			and returns a value then said value shall be returned, and in any other case a null
			value shall be returned.
